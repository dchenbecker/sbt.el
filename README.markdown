# sbt.el #

## Getting started ##

There are two main ways to get started with `sbt.el`. Either through [el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get) or manually

### el-get ###

Add to your emacs init.el/initialization or el-get configuration.

```lisp
(add-to-list 'el-get-sources
  (:name sbt
   :website "https://github.com/rubbish/sbt.el"
   :description "support for running sbt in inferior mode."
   :type github
   :pkgname "rubbish/sbt.el"
   :post-init (add-hook 'scala-mode 'turn-on-sbt-mode)))
```

### Manually ###

  1. Clone somewhere onto your emacs load-path.
  2. Add to your emacs init.el or initialization.

```lisp
(autoload 'turn-on-sbt-mode "sbt" "" t)
(add-hook 'scala-mode 'turn-on-sbt-mode)
```

## Keybindings ##

  * `C-c s s` -- starts an interactive sbt repl
  * `C-c s c` -- sends `compile` to the sbt repl
  * `C-c s t` -- sends `test` to the sbt repl
  * `C-c s o` -- if in a test file, sends `test-only com.test.SomeTest` to the sbt repl
